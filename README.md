**Introduction**
This study analyses the seasonal mechanisms of extreme temperatures in Northwich, UK. While summer heatwaves are widely studied, the drivers for transitional seasons remain unclear. We address why high temperature variability, such as in autumn, does not always yield more extremes. By analyzing the coupling of air temperature with radiation and moisture, we quantify the "driver shift" across seasons.

**Dataset Resource**
The datasets for this study are secondary data extracted from the CESM Large Ensemble Community Project (LENS), developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

**Result**
Extreme temperatures in Northwich are governed by distinct seasonal drivers. Spring sees the highest frequency, whereas summer extremes result from a mean temperature shift rather than variability. Mechanistically, solar radiation and water vapor act synergistically in spring and summer, but this relationship weakens in autumn and reverses in winter. These findings highlight the need for season-specific climate risk assessments.
