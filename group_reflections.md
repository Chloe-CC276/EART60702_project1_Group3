# Group3 Project1 Reflections
## Jing Chen

Our team had clear division,smooth collaboration and communication,making this a very pleasant group project.Everyone took responsibility and actively joined in topic selection,material searching and coding,and we finished this complete project report.  
The innovation of this project is that we fully considered the seasonal climate characteristics.By comparing differences across four seasons,we revealed the main climatic factors driving extreme temperatures in different seasons,supporting more accurate judgments of regional climate differences.  
However, the project still has some limitations:  

1.**The definition of extreme temperature is still not rigorous enough.** When screening extreme temperatures in data preprocessing,we only roughly selected outliers beyond the 95% confidence interval,without considering that some of these values may lie within the human thermal comfort range.  

2.**The core objective was described too generally.** In the future, we should better target existing research gaps and further explore the value of our results for social decision-making — for example,how crops respond to the combined effects of extreme temperatures and key climatic factors in agriculture.  

3.**The final result is not clear in initial planning.** The full research path should be planned more carefully at the initial stage for a clearer overall design.
